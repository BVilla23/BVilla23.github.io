    Sitting atop Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, <i><b>Christo Redentor</b></i> is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable monuments in the world. It’s one of the largest statues of Jesus and the tallest art deco statue in the world. Christo Redentor reaches a height of 30 metres and boasts an arm span of 28 metres.Each year, Christ the Redeemer is visited by nearly 2 million people. The record number of visitors to the statue in a single day was a huge 14,000 during Easter of 2011. The statue of Jesus made it on the list of New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007, and since then its star shines brightly.
    <p>The most famous and traditional way how to reach Christ the Redeemer is by cog train. The train will take you through Atlantic Forest almost to the top of Corcovado Mountain. Once there, you can see everything: the bay of Guanabara and the bridge that spans it, the Maracanã stadium, the Centro (business district where tourists never go), Sugar Loaf, Copacabana beach, Ipanema, the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, the Botanical Garden, countless favelas and the Tijuca Rainforest.
